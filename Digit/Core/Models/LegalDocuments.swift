# Digit App Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** May 16, 2025

---

## Introduction

The developer of the Digit App (“we” or “us”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes what minimal personal data we collect, how we use and safeguard it, and your rights regarding this data.

We do not collect any unnecessary or sensitive information, and we never sell your data or use it for advertising or monetization purposes. By using the Digit App (“the App”), you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

---

## Data Collection and Use

We collect only the minimal personal data required to provide and improve the App's core functionality. We believe in data minimization and avoid collecting any data that is not essential. Below is an overview of the information we may collect and how we use it:

- **Account Information:** If you create an account or log in to the App, we may collect basic identifiers such as your name, email address, or username. This information is used solely to create your user account, authenticate you, and allow you to use the App's features. We do not use this information for any other purpose.

- **Device and Technical Data:** When you use the App, we may automatically collect certain technical data for core functionality and diagnostics. This can include information like your device type, operating system version, App version, and non-identifying device identifiers. We use this data to ensure the App works correctly on different devices, to diagnose crashes or bugs, and to improve compatibility and performance.

- **No Sale of Personal Information:** We never sell or rent your personal information to third parties, under any circumstances. "Personal information" includes things like your name, contact information, and any other data related to you. Even under the broad definitions of laws like the California Consumer Privacy Act (which defines "sale" very broadly to include some sharing of data for advantage), we do not engage in any such practices. Your data is yours; we only use it to provide the service to you.

In short, you can use the Digit App confident that your personal data is not being used for commercial gain by us or by any third parties. Our revenue (if any) comes from legitimate product usage (such as subscription or purchase fees for premium features, if applicable) and not from your data. If this policy ever changes (which we do not foresee), we would update this Privacy Policy and obtain any necessary consent from you, but as of the Effective Date below, we maintain a strict no-ads, no-tracking, no-selling-data policy.

---

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not disclose your personal information to third parties, except in a few narrow circumstances necessary to operate the App or as required by law. These circumstances are:

- **Service Providers:** As noted above, we may share minimal data with trusted third-party service providers who perform functions on our behalf (such as authentication and crash analysis). Each of these providers is bound by contractual privacy obligations (through Data Processing Agreements or similar) to keep your data secure and to use it only for the specific service they provide to us. They cannot use or disclose your data for their own purposes.

- **Legal Compliance:** We may disclose personal information if we are required to do so by law or valid legal process (for example, in response to a court order, subpoena, or law enforcement demand). We will only do so after verifying the request's validity and only provide the minimum information necessary to comply with the law. Where possible and lawful, we will notify you of such requests.

- **Protection of Rights and Safety:** We may disclose information if we believe in good faith that it is necessary to protect our rights, property, or safety, or that of our users or the public. For example, this might include sharing information with authorities to prevent fraud, security breaches, or to investigate violations of our terms of service or this Privacy Policy.

- **Business Transfers:** If the Digit App or its development company is involved in a merger, acquisition, sale of assets, or other business transaction, user information (to the extent we have any) may be transferred to the successor or new owner as part of that deal. If such a transfer occurs, we will ensure that the successor is bound to the same commitments described in this Privacy Policy. We will notify you (for example, via in-app notice or email) of any change in ownership or use of your personal data, as well as any choices you may have regarding that data.

Outside of the scenarios above, we do not share your data with any third parties. Specifically, we do not give any third-party companies or individuals access to our user databases or any personal identifiers for any commercial or unrelated purposes. Your data remains securely with us (and our service providers acting on our behalf) and is not divulged further.

---

## Data Retention and Deletion

We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy or as required by law, after which it is deleted or anonymized. Below is our data retention policy in detail:

- **Active Account Data:** If you have created an account in the App, we will retain your account information (such as your email and any profile info) for as long as your account remains active. This allows us to provide you with continuous access to the App each time you use it.

- **Inactive Accounts:** If you stop using the App and your account remains inactive for an extended period, we may periodically review and delete or anonymize the personal data associated with your account to reduce storage of data that is no longer needed. We will generally provide a notice (e.g., via email) before deleting an inactive account, allowing you the opportunity to keep it active if you wish.

- **Deletion Upon Request:** You have the right to request deletion of your personal data at any time. (See "Your Privacy Rights" below for more on how to exercise this right.) Upon receiving a verified deletion request, we will delete or de-identify the personal information we hold about you, except for information we are legally permitted or required to retain. We will also instruct our service providers to delete the personal data they hold on our behalf (for example, your information in the authentication service) to the extent required by law.

- **Retention for Legal Obligations:** In certain cases, we may need to retain some information for a longer period if required for legal reasons. For instance, if we are required to keep records for tax, audit, or compliance purposes, or if there is an unresolved issue like an open claim or dispute, we will retain the necessary data until the issue is resolved or the legally required period ends. During this time, your data will continue to be protected under the terms of this Privacy Policy.

**Backup and Residual Copies:**

Despite all these precautions, it's important to understand that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee absolute security. Cyber threats evolve quickly, and there is always a residual risk that a breach could occur. In the unlikely event of a data breach or security incident affecting your personal information, we will act promptly to contain and investigate the issue. If your data is involved in a breach that poses a risk to your rights or freedoms, we will notify you and any applicable regulatory authorities in accordance with applicable laws (for example, under the EU GDPR we would notify the relevant Data Protection Authority and users within 72 hours of becoming aware of a qualifying breach).

**Your Responsibilities:**

You also play an important role in keeping your information secure. We encourage you to use a strong, unique password for your account (if applicable) and to keep your login credentials confidential. Do not share your account information with others, and notify us immediately if you suspect any unauthorized access to your account. We are not responsible for breaches or incidents that are caused by your own negligence in protecting login details or by malware or attacks on your own devices.

---

## International Data Transfers

We operate in [Your Country] (Note: replace with relevant country or region) and our servers and service providers may be located in other jurisdictions. This means that your information may be transferred to and stored on servers in a country different from your home country. For example, if you are located in the European Union (EU) or European Economic Area (EEA), and our servers or service providers are located in the United States or elsewhere, your personal data will be processed and stored outside of the EU/EEA.

We are mindful of international data protection requirements and take steps to ensure that an adequate level of protection is applied to your personal information no matter where it is processed. If you are in a jurisdiction like the EU that has data export restrictions, we rely on appropriate legal mechanisms to transfer data lawfully across borders. These may include, for instance, the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or other safeguards as required by GDPR, or your consent where appropriate.

By using the Digit App, or by providing us with information, you consent to the transfer of your personal data to other countries as needed for our operational purposes. We will always handle your information as described in this Privacy Policy, and the protections described herein will travel with your data. If you have questions about international data transfers or the safeguards we have in place, feel free to contact us using the information in the Contact section below.

---

## Your Privacy Rights

We respect your privacy rights and comply with applicable data protection laws, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) (as amended by the CPRA). Depending on your residency or location, you may have specific rights regarding your personal information. This section outlines those rights and how you can exercise them.

### Rights for Users in the European Union/European Economic Area (GDPR)

If you are in the EU/EEA or otherwise subject to GDPR, you have the following data protection rights:

- **Right to Access:** You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we hold about you, as well as information about how we use it. We will provide you with a copy of your data in a commonly used format, usually within 30 days of your request.

- **Right to Rectification:** If any personal information we have about you is incorrect or incomplete, you have the right to request that we correct or update it. We encourage you to keep your information up-to-date and will make corrections promptly upon verification of the new information.

- **Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten):** You have the right to request that we delete your personal data. When you exercise this right, we will erase your personal information from our records (and instruct our processors to do the same), provided that we do not have a legal obligation to retain it. Please note that after deletion, certain information (like posts or content you may have shared, if any) might be anonymized or made unavailable, and residual copies might persist temporarily in backups (as described in Data Retention above).

- **Right to Restrict Processing:** You can request that we limit the processing of your data in certain circumstances – for example, if you contest the accuracy of the data or object to us processing it. When processing is restricted, we will still store your data but will not use it until the issue is resolved (except to the extent necessary for security or legal reasons).

- **Right to Withdraw Consent:** In the limited cases where we might rely on your consent to process data (for example, if you explicitly agreed to share optional information or to receive communications), you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawing consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we already conducted while relying on your consent, and it won't affect processing of data under other legal bases, but it means we will stop the specific activity you had consented to.

If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the contact information at the end of this Policy. We may need to verify your identity before fulfilling certain requests (to ensure that we do not disclose or delete data at the request of an impostor). Verification might involve confirming your email address or asking for information that only the real account holder would know. We will respond to your request as soon as possible, and at latest within the timeframe required by GDPR (generally within 30 days). If we cannot fulfill your request (for example, if you ask us to delete data which we are legally required to keep), we will inform you of the reason. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your country's Data Protection Authority (DPA) or supervisory authority if you believe we have infringed your privacy rights. We kindly ask that you contact us first so we can address your concerns directly.

### Rights for California Residents (CCPA/CPRA)

If you are a resident of California, you are protected by privacy rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA). These laws provide you (as a "consumer") specific rights regarding your personal information, which include:

- **Right to Opt-Out of Sale or Sharing of Personal Information:** The CCPA gives you the right to opt out of the "sale" of your personal information. However, as stated above, we do not sell or share your personal information for monetary or other valuable consideration. We do not disclose your data to third parties for advertising or marketing, so there is no "sale" or "sharing" (as defined by CCPA/CPRA) occurring that you need to opt out of. We treat all users, including California residents, as if they have already opted out of data sale/sharing by default.

- **Right to Correct Inaccurate Information:** Under CPRA, California residents also have the right to request correction of inaccurate personal information maintained by a business. If you believe any information we have about you is incorrect, please let us know and we will correct it (taking into account the nature of the information and the purposes of processing it).

- **Right to Non-Discrimination:** We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. This means, for example, we will not deny you our services, charge you a different price, or provide a lesser quality of service just because you exercised your rights under the CCPA. The Digit App is provided under the same terms to all users regardless of any privacy choices you make. If you do exercise any right and feel you are being treated unfairly as a result, please inform us immediately so we can address it – but we anticipate no such issues given our practices.

**Exercising Your California Privacy Rights:**

If you are a California resident and wish to exercise your Right to Know, Right to Delete, Right to Correct, or any other right under CCPA/CPRA, you (or an authorized agent acting on your behalf) can send us a request via the contact information in the Contact section below. Please specify which right you intend to exercise and provide us with sufficient information to verify your identity. Typically, verification will involve confirming at least two pieces of personal information that we have on file (for instance, verifying your email address or other account details) – this is to ensure we do not give out personal information to the wrong person or delete the wrong account. We aim to respond to verified requests within 45 days as required by CCPA. If we need more time (up to an additional 45 days, for a total of 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension in writing. There is no fee for making a verifiable request unless it is excessive or repetitive, in which case we will explain the reason and provide a cost estimate before proceeding.

**Shine the Light Law:**

In addition to CCPA, California's "Shine the Light" law (Civil Code Section § 1798.83) allows users of our App who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. However, as stated, we do not share any personal information with third parties for direct marketing purposes. Therefore, there is no information to provide under this law. If you have questions about this, you can still contact us and we will respond accordingly.

## Children's Privacy

Protecting the privacy of children is especially important. The Digit App is not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years old (or under 16 in certain jurisdictions where additional protections apply) without parental consent. If you are under the age of 13, please do not use the App or provide any information about yourself. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected personal data from a child under the relevant age without proper consent, we will take immediate steps to delete that information from our servers.

If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that your child under 13 (or under 16, as applicable) has provided us with personal information, please contact us as soon as possible (see Contact Information below). We will promptly investigate and remove the information and terminate the child's account if one exists. We comply with the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and similar laws around the world that aim to protect children's privacy.

---

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make material changes to how we handle your personal information, we will take appropriate measures to inform you of these changes. This may include, for example, posting an in-app notice or sending you a notification (if we have your contact information) informing you of the updated policy. The "Effective Date" at the bottom of this Privacy Policy will always indicate when the latest changes were made.

We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information. Your continued use of the App after an updated Privacy Policy goes into effect will indicate your acceptance of the revised terms. If you do not agree with any changes to the Privacy Policy, you should stop using the App and, if applicable, disable your account or contact us to have your data removed.

---

## Limitation of Liability and Disclaimers

- **No Warranties:** The Digit App and all services provided through it are offered on an "as-is" and "as-available" basis, without warranties of any kind. While we strive for accuracy, reliability, and security, we do not guarantee that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or completely secure. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, express or implied, regarding the App and this Privacy Policy, including any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. You use the App at your own discretion and risk.

- **User Responsibility:** It is your responsibility to use the App in compliance with all applicable laws and to keep your own devices and account credentials secure. You agree that we are not liable for any unauthorized access to or alteration of your data that occurs due to your failure to safeguard your account (such as sharing your password or using a weak password), nor are we responsible for any content or information that you choose to share or submit publicly via the App (if such features exist). Any misuse of the App by you (including violating our terms of service or using the App to engage in unlawful activities) will be solely your responsibility.

- **Indemnification and Hold Harmless:** (If applicable) By using the App, you agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any losses, liability, claims, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) that arise from your violation of this Privacy Policy or misuse of the App. (Note: This clause may be more typical in Terms of Service, but we include it here to emphasize user responsibility and developer protection.)

- **No Waiver:** No failure or delay by us in exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Privacy Policy will operate as a waiver of it, nor will any single or partial exercise of any right, power, or privilege preclude any further exercise of the same or any other right, power, or privilege.

- **Jurisdictional Rights:** Some jurisdictions do not allow certain exclusions or limitations of liability or warranties. If laws applicable to you do not allow the disclaimers or limitations above to the extent written, those provisions shall apply to you only to the extent permitted by such laws. Nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to contravene any mandatory rights you have under law; instead, this section is intended to provide the maximum protection to us (the App developer) allowed by your jurisdiction's laws.
