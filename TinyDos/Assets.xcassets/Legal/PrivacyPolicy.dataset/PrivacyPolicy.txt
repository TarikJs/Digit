# Digit App Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** May 16, 2025

---

## Introduction

The developer of the Digit App (“we” or “us”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes what minimal personal data we collect, how we use and safeguard it, and your rights regarding this data. We do not collect any unnecessary or sensitive information, and we never sell your data or use it for advertising or monetization purposes. By using the Digit App (“the App”), you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

---

## Data Collection and Use

We collect only the minimal personal data required to provide and improve the App's core functionality. We believe in data minimization and avoid collecting any data that is not essential. Below is an overview of the information we may collect and how we use it:

- **Account Information:** If you create an account or log in to the App, we may collect basic identifiers such as your name, email address, or username. This information is used solely to create your user account, authenticate you, and allow you to use the App's features. We do not use this information for any other purpose.
- **Device and Technical Data:** When you use the App, we may automatically collect certain technical data for core functionality and diagnostics. This can include information like your device type, operating system version, App version, and non-identifying device identifiers. We use this data to ensure the App works correctly on different devices, to diagnose crashes or bugs, and to improve compatibility and performance.
- **Usage Data:** We do not collect detailed usage or behavior profiles. We do not track how you individually navigate or use the App beyond basic aggregated metrics. The App may record general logs (e.g., that a feature was used or a session time) purely to help us understand overall usage trends and improve functionality. These analytics, if collected at all, are aggregate and anonymized – they are not tied to your identity.
- **Communication Data:** If you contact us for support or feedback (for example, via email), we will collect the information you voluntarily provide (such as your contact details and the content of your message). We use this information only to respond to your inquiry and assist you. We do not use support communications for any marketing purposes.

**Purpose Limitation:**
We use all collected data strictly for the purposes stated above and no other purposes. In summary, your information is used only to operate and maintain the App, provide customer support when requested, improve the App's quality (e.g., by fixing crashes), and comply with any legal obligations. We do not profile you, target you with ads, or collect any data beyond what is necessary to serve you as a user of the App.

---

## No Location or Sensitive Data Collected

We want to reassure you that we do not collect any sensitive personal information or device data that is not essential. In particular:

- **No Location Data:** The Digit App does not request or track your location. We do not access your device's GPS and do not collect any precise or approximate location information about you.
- **No Biometric Data:** The App does not collect biometric identifiers or information. We do not access or store any fingerprint data, facial recognition data, voiceprints, or any other biometric identifiers from your device. (If you use device-level biometrics for authentication, such as fingerprint or Face ID to unlock the App, that process happens entirely on your device and is not transmitted to us.)
- **No Health or Medical Data:** We do not collect any health, medical, or fitness information from you or your device. The App has no integration with HealthKit or any health/medical databases.
- **No Other Sensitive Personal Information:** We do not collect any sensitive categories of personal data such as your racial or ethnic origin, religious or political beliefs, genetic data, or sexual orientation. We also do not collect financial information (e.g. credit card numbers) or any government-issued identifiers through the App. (If the App at any point needs to process a payment, it will redirect you to a secure third-party payment processor, and we will not see or store your payment details.)

By limiting data collection in this way, we minimize risks to your privacy. We only collect the information you knowingly provide (like an email for account creation) or basic technical data required for the App to function. If a piece of information is not expressly listed in this Policy, then we do not collect it.

---

## Third-Party Service Providers (Core Functionality Only)

We utilize a few trusted third-party services strictly to support the core functionality of the App. These third-party providers are used only for technical necessities (such as user authentication and crash reporting) and not for marketing or advertising purposes. We share with them only the minimum data needed, and they are contractually obliged to protect your information and use it only for the specified purposes. The third-party services we use include:

- **User Authentication:** We may use a secure third-party authentication service (for example, Firebase Authentication by Google, Apple Sign-in, or a similar provider) to manage user sign-ups and logins. This means that when you register or log in, your credentials (such as email and password, or your OAuth token if using Google/Apple login) are processed by that service to verify your identity. We do not store your raw password on our servers (passwords are handled securely via the authentication provider). The authentication provider will have access to your basic account information (e.g., email address or unique user ID) purely for the purpose of managing your login and enabling you to securely access the App. They are not permitted to use your data for any other purpose.
- **Crash Reporting and Analytics:** In order to maintain a high quality of service, we use a third-party crash analytics tool (for example, Google Firebase Crashlytics, Sentry, or a similar service) to automatically collect crash reports and error logs when the App experiences a malfunction. These crash reports help us diagnose issues and improve the App's stability. The information collected in a crash report typically includes technical details such as device model, operating system version, the App's state at the time of the crash, and non-personal device identifiers (like a random installation ID). Importantly, crash reports do not include your personal user data; they are solely focused on the technical circumstances of a crash. We do not receive any information about your identity from crash reports. The crash analytics service acts only on our behalf to process this diagnostic information, and it is not allowed to use crash data for any purpose other than providing us with crash diagnostics.

Aside from the services above, we do not integrate any third-party SDKs or services that collect personal data for advertising, marketing, or other unrelated purposes. We do not use third-party analytics services that track your behavior across apps or websites, and we do not share data with social networks or advertisers. Our use of third parties is strictly limited to the operational needs of the App.

**Third-Party Platforms (App Stores):**
Please note that this Privacy Policy does not cover any data collection that may be conducted by the platform through which you download the App (for example, the Apple App Store or Google Play Store). Those platforms might collect certain information (such as general device info or app purchase history) in accordance with their own privacy policies. We have no control over and are not responsible for data that the App Store or platform provider may collect from you. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any such platform or service provider for information about their data practices.

---

## No Advertising, Monetization, or Data Sales

We take your privacy seriously and have made a deliberate choice to avoid any practices that would monetize or exploit your data. Specifically:

- **No Advertising:** The Digit App does not display any third-party ads, nor do we use any advertising networks or ad trackers. You will never be subject to targeted advertising by using our App, because we simply do not engage in advertising or profiling of our users.
- **No Data Monetization:** We do not monetize the data you entrust to us. That means we do not use your personal information for marketing, we do not build marketing profiles, and we do not sell your usage patterns or any data about you to anyone. The App's business model does not depend on exploiting user data in any way.
- **No Sale of Personal Information:** We never sell or rent your personal information to third parties, under any circumstances. "Personal information" includes things like your name, contact information, and any other data related to you. Even under the broad definitions of laws like the California Consumer Privacy Act (which defines "sale" very broadly to include some sharing of data for advantage), we do not engage in any such practices. Your data is yours; we only use it to provide the service to you.

In short, you can use the Digit App confident that your personal data is not being used for commercial gain by us or by any third parties. Our revenue (if any) comes from legitimate product usage (such as subscription or purchase fees for premium features, if applicable) and not from your data. If this policy ever changes (which we do not foresee), we would update this Privacy Policy and obtain any necessary consent from you, but as of the Effective Date below, we maintain a strict no-ads, no-tracking, no-selling-data policy.

---

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not disclose your personal information to third parties, except in a few narrow circumstances necessary to operate the App or as required by law. These circumstances are:

- **Service Providers:** As noted above, we may share minimal data with trusted third-party service providers who perform functions on our behalf (such as authentication and crash analysis). Each of these providers is bound by contractual privacy obligations (through Data Processing Agreements or similar) to keep your data secure and to use it only for the specific service they provide to us. They cannot use or disclose your data for their own purposes.
- **Legal Compliance:** We may disclose personal information if we are required to do so by law or valid legal process (for example, in response to a court order, subpoena, or law enforcement demand). We will only do so after verifying the request's validity and only provide the minimum information necessary to comply with the law. Where possible and lawful, we will notify you of such requests.
- **Protection of Rights and Safety:** We may disclose information if we believe in good faith that it is necessary to protect our rights, property, or safety, or that of our users or the public. For example, this might include sharing information with authorities to prevent fraud, security breaches, or to investigate violations of our terms of service or this Privacy Policy.
- **Business Transfers:** If the Digit App or its development company is involved in a merger, acquisition, sale of assets, or other business transaction, user information (to the extent we have any) may be transferred to the successor or new owner as part of that deal. If such a transfer occurs, we will ensure that the successor is bound to the same commitments described in this Privacy Policy. We will notify you (for example, via in-app notice or email) of any change in ownership or use of your personal data, as well as any choices you may have regarding that data.

Outside of the scenarios above, we do not share your data with any third parties. Specifically, we do not give any third-party companies or individuals access to our user databases or any personal identifiers for any commercial or unrelated purposes. Your data remains securely with us (and our service providers acting on our behalf) and is not divulged further.

---

## Data Retention and Deletion

We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy or as required by law, after which it is deleted or anonymized. Below is our data retention policy in detail:

- **Active Account Data:** If you have created an account in the App, we will retain your account information (such as your email and any profile info) for as long as your account remains active. This allows us to provide you with continuous access to the App each time you use it.
- **Inactive Accounts:** If you stop using the App and your account remains inactive for an extended period, we may periodically review and delete or anonymize the personal data associated with your account to reduce storage of data that is no longer needed. We will generally provide a notice (e.g., via email) before deleting an inactive account, allowing you the opportunity to keep it active if you wish.
- **Deletion Upon Request:** You have the right to request deletion of your personal data at any time. (See "Your Privacy Rights" below for more on how to exercise this right.) Upon receiving a verified deletion request, we will delete or de-identify the personal information we hold about you, except for information we are legally permitted or required to retain. We will also instruct our service providers to delete the personal data they hold on our behalf (for example, your information in the authentication service) to the extent required by law.
- **Retention for Legal Obligations:** In certain cases, we may need to retain some information for a longer period if required for legal reasons. For instance, if we are required to keep records for tax, audit, or compliance purposes, or if there is an unresolved issue like an open claim or dispute, we will retain the necessary data until the issue is resolved or the legally required period ends. During this time, your data will continue to be protected under the terms of this Privacy Policy.

**Backup and Residual Copies:**
Please note that when we delete data from our active systems, it might not be instantly removed from all backup systems. We maintain backups to ensure service continuity and disaster recovery. Thus, your data may remain in encrypted backups for a short period until those backups are cycled out. We also may retain anonymized or aggregated data (which is not identifiable to you) for analytical purposes. However, rest assured that your personal data will not remain in our active databases once you've requested deletion (and we've confirmed your identity and request), and any residual backup data will be purged in the normal course of our backup retention schedule.

---

## Data Security

We take the security of your data very seriously and implement industry-standard security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of your personal information. Some of the security practices we employ include:

- **Encryption:** All communications between the App and our servers (or our third-party service providers) are encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS), ensuring that data in transit cannot be easily intercepted. If we store any personal information, we also use encryption at rest on our databases or rely on trusted cloud providers that implement strong encryption for stored data.
- **Access Controls:** Personal data is accessible only to those who need it to perform their duties (for example, limited members of our development team or support staff), and even then it is on a need-to-know basis. Administrative access to systems containing personal data is protected with strong authentication (such as multi-factor authentication) to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Security Testing and Updates:** We regularly update our application and backend systems with security patches and perform testing to identify and fix vulnerabilities. We also utilize secure coding practices during development to prevent common security issues.
- **Vendor Due Diligence:** When we utilize third-party service providers (as described above), we choose reputable companies with strong security track records. We also ensure through agreements that they are required to maintain adequate security measures.

Despite all these precautions, it's important to understand that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee absolute security. Cyber threats evolve quickly, and there is always a residual risk that a breach could occur. In the unlikely event of a data breach or security incident affecting your personal information, we will act promptly to contain and investigate the issue. If your data is involved in a breach that poses a risk to your rights or freedoms, we will notify you and any applicable regulatory authorities in accordance with applicable laws (for example, under the EU GDPR we would notify the relevant Data Protection Authority and users within 72 hours of becoming aware of a qualifying breach).

**Your Responsibilities:**
You also play an important role in keeping your information secure. We encourage you to use a strong, unique password for your account (if applicable) and to keep your login credentials confidential. Do not share your account information with others, and notify us immediately if you suspect any unauthorized access to your account. We are not responsible for breaches or incidents that are caused by your own negligence in protecting login details or by malware or attacks on your own devices.

---

## International Data Transfers

We operate in [Your Country] (Note: replace with relevant country or region) and our servers and service providers may be located in other jurisdictions. This means that your information may be transferred to and stored on servers in a country different from your home country. For example, if you are located in the European Union (EU) or European Economic Area (EEA), and our servers or service providers are located in the United States or elsewhere, your personal data will be processed and stored outside of the EU/EEA.

We are mindful of international data protection requirements and take steps to ensure that an adequate level of protection is applied to your personal information no matter where it is processed. If you are in a jurisdiction like the EU that has data export restrictions, we rely on appropriate legal mechanisms to transfer data lawfully across borders. These may include, for instance, the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or other safeguards as required by GDPR, or your consent where appropriate.

By using the Digit App, or by providing us with information, you consent to the transfer of your personal data to other countries as needed for our operational purposes. We will always handle your information as described in this Privacy Policy, and the protections described herein will travel with your data. If you have questions about international data transfers or the safeguards we have in place, feel free to contact us using the information in the Contact section below.

## Your Privacy Rights

We respect your privacy rights and comply with applicable data protection laws, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) (as amended by the CPRA). Depending on your residency or location, you may have specific rights regarding your personal information. This section outlines those rights and how you can exercise them.

### Rights for Users in the European Union/European Economic Area (GDPR)

If you are in the EU/EEA or otherwise subject to GDPR, you have the following data protection rights:

- **Right to Access:** You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we hold about you, as well as information about how we use it. We will provide you with a copy of your data in a commonly used format, usually within 30 days of your request.
- **Right to Rectification:** If any personal information we have about you is incorrect or incomplete, you have the right to request that we correct or update it. We encourage you to keep your information up-to-date and will make corrections promptly upon verification of the new information.
- **Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten):** You have the right to request that we delete your personal data. When you exercise this right, we will erase your personal information from our records (and instruct our processors to do the same), provided that we do not have a legal obligation to retain it. Please note that after deletion, certain information (like posts or content you may have shared, if any) might be anonymized or made unavailable, and residual copies might persist temporarily in backups (as described in Data Retention above).
- **Right to Restrict Processing:** You can request that we limit the processing of your data in certain circumstances – for example, if you contest the accuracy of the data or object to us processing it. When processing is restricted, we will still store your data but will not use it until the issue is resolved (except to the extent necessary for security or legal reasons).
- **Right to Data Portability:** You have the right to obtain your personal data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, and to have that data transmitted to another controller where technically feasible. In practice, this means you can ask us for a copy of the data you provided to us (for example, the information you entered when creating your account) and we will provide it in a CSV or similar format so that you could reuse it or transfer it to a different service.
- **Right to Object:** You have the right to object to our processing of your personal information if we are processing it on the legal basis of legitimate interests or for direct marketing. Given that we do not use your data for marketing and only process minimal data for providing the service, this will typically mean you could object to any analytics or processing we do for improvement of the service. If you raise an objection, we will consider it and stop or adjust processing unless we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue (in accordance with GDPR).
- **Right Not to be Subject to Automated Decisions:** We do not carry out any automated decision-making or profiling that has legal or similarly significant effects on you. However, you have the right to not be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning you. (This right is largely not applicable to our App since we don't do such processing.)
- **Right to Withdraw Consent:** In the limited cases where we might rely on your consent to process data (for example, if you explicitly agreed to share optional information or to receive communications), you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawing consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we already conducted while relying on your consent, and it won't affect processing of data under other legal bases, but it means we will stop the specific activity you had consented to.

If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the contact information at the end of this Policy. We may need to verify your identity before fulfilling certain requests (to ensure that we do not disclose or delete data at the request of an impostor). Verification might involve confirming your email address or asking for information that only the real account holder would know. We will respond to your request as soon as possible, and at latest within the timeframe required by GDPR (generally within 30 days). If we cannot fulfill your request (for example, if you ask us to delete data which we are legally required to keep), we will inform you of the reason. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your country's Data Protection Authority (DPA) or supervisory authority if you believe we have infringed your privacy rights. We kindly ask that you contact us first so we can address your concerns directly.

### Rights for California Residents (CCPA/CPRA)

If you are a resident of California, you are protected by privacy rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA). These laws provide you (as a "consumer") specific rights regarding your personal information, which include:

- **Right to Know:** You have the right to request that we disclose what personal information we have collected about you in the 12-month period preceding your request, including the categories of personal information collected, the sources of that information, the business or commercial purpose for collecting it, and the categories of third parties with whom we share that information. You also have the right to request the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you. (Please note, as described in this Policy, we collect very minimal personal data. We can provide you with the overview of that data, such as your account email and any technical IDs associated with your use of the App.)
- **Right to Delete:** You have the right to request that we delete any personal information we have collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and verify your California consumer deletion request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies. Exceptions may include, for example, if the information is needed to complete a transaction you requested, to detect security incidents, to exercise free speech or another legal right, to comply with a legal obligation, or for certain internal uses that are compatible with the context in which you provided it. We will inform you if any such exception applies in your case.
- **Right to Opt-Out of Sale or Sharing of Personal Information:** The CCPA gives you the right to opt out of the "sale" of your personal information. However, as stated above, we do not sell or share your personal information for monetary or other valuable consideration. We do not disclose your data to third parties for advertising or marketing, so there is no "sale" or "sharing" (as defined by CCPA/CPRA) occurring that you need to opt out of. We treat all users, including California residents, as if they have already opted out of data sale/sharing by default.
- **Right to Correct Inaccurate Information:** Under CPRA, California residents also have the right to request correction of inaccurate personal information maintained by a business. If you believe any information we have about you is incorrect, please let us know and we will correct it (taking into account the nature of the information and the purposes of processing it).
- **Right to Non-Discrimination:** We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. This means, for example, we will not deny you our services, charge you a different price, or provide a lesser quality of service just because you exercised your rights under the CCPA. The Digit App is provided under the same terms to all users regardless of any privacy choices you make. If you do exercise any right and feel you are being treated unfairly as a result, please inform us immediately so we can address it – but we anticipate no such issues given our practices.

**Exercising Your California Privacy Rights:**
If you are a California resident and wish to exercise your Right to Know, Right to Delete, Right to Correct, or any other right under CCPA/CPRA, you (or an authorized agent acting on your behalf) can send us a request via the contact information in the Contact section below. Please specify which right you intend to exercise and provide us with sufficient information to verify your identity. Typically, verification will involve confirming at least two pieces of personal information that we have on file (for instance, verifying your email address or other account details) – this is to ensure we do not give out personal information to the wrong person or delete the wrong account. We aim to respond to verified requests within 45 days as required by CCPA. If we need more time (up to an additional 45 days, for a total of 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension in writing. There is no fee for making a verifiable request unless it is excessive or repetitive, in which case we will explain the reason and provide a cost estimate before proceeding.

**Shine the Light Law:**
In addition to CCPA, California's "Shine the Light" law (Civil Code Section § 1798.83) allows users of our App who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. However, as stated, we do not share any personal information with third parties for direct marketing purposes. Therefore, there is no information to provide under this law. If you have questions about this, you can still contact us and we will respond accordingly.

## Children's Privacy

Protecting the privacy of children is especially important. The Digit App is not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years old (or under 16 in certain jurisdictions where additional protections apply) without parental consent. If you are under the age of 13, please do not use the App or provide any information about yourself. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected personal data from a child under the relevant age without proper consent, we will take immediate steps to delete that information from our servers.

If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that your child under 13 (or under 16, as applicable) has provided us with personal information, please contact us as soon as possible (see Contact Information below). We will promptly investigate and remove the information and terminate the child's account if one exists. We comply with the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and similar laws around the world that aim to protect children's privacy.

---

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make material changes to how we handle your personal information, we will take appropriate measures to inform you of these changes. This may include, for example, posting an in-app notice or sending you a notification (if we have your contact information) informing you of the updated policy. The "Effective Date" at the bottom of this Privacy Policy will always indicate when the latest changes were made.

We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information. Your continued use of the App after an updated Privacy Policy goes into effect will indicate your acceptance of the revised terms. If you do not agree with any changes to the Privacy Policy, you should stop using the App and, if applicable, disable your account or contact us to have your data removed.

---

## Limitation of Liability and Disclaimers

- **No Warranties:** The Digit App and all services provided through it are offered on an "as-is" and "as-available" basis, without warranties of any kind. While we strive for accuracy, reliability, and security, we do not guarantee that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or completely secure. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, express or implied, regarding the App and this Privacy Policy, including any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. You use the App at your own discretion and risk.
- **User Responsibility:** It is your responsibility to use the App in compliance with all applicable laws and to keep your own devices and account credentials secure. You agree that we are not liable for any unauthorized access to or alteration of your data that occurs due to your failure to safeguard your account (such as sharing your password or using a weak password), nor are we responsible for any content or information that you choose to share or submit publicly via the App (if such features exist). Any misuse of the App by you (including violating our terms of service or using the App to engage in unlawful activities) will be solely your responsibility.
- **Third-Party Services Disclaimer:** We use reputable third-party service providers for certain functions (as described above), but we do not have direct control over their operations. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security or faultlessness on their part. We are not responsible for any breaches, data losses, or incidents that occur due to the actions or omissions of third-party providers or platforms that are outside our control. However, we will make reasonable efforts to address and remediate any issues that arise with our service providers, and we will notify affected users of any significant incident as required by law.
- **Limitation of Liability:** To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall we (the developer of the Digit App) be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages whatsoever arising out of or relating to your use of (or inability to use) the App, any content on the App, or this Privacy Policy. This includes, without limitation, damages for lost profits, lost data, loss of goodwill, device damage, or other intangible losses, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. In jurisdictions that do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages, we will be liable to you only to the minimal extent required by law. Furthermore, our total aggregate liability for any claims arising out of or related to the App or this Privacy Policy is limited to the amount (if any) you paid us for the service in the past twelve months (or, if greater, fifty U.S. dollars ($50)). This limitation applies regardless of the theory of liability (contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or otherwise) and even if a limited remedy fails of its essential purpose.
- **Indemnification and Hold Harmless:** (If applicable) By using the App, you agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any losses, liability, claims, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) that arise from your violation of this Privacy Policy or misuse of the App. (Note: This clause may be more typical in Terms of Service, but we include it here to emphasize user responsibility and developer protection.)
- **No Waiver:** No failure or delay by us in exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Privacy Policy will operate as a waiver of it, nor will any single or partial exercise of any right, power, or privilege preclude any further exercise of the same or any other right, power, or privilege.
- **Jurisdictional Rights:** Some jurisdictions do not allow certain exclusions or limitations of liability or warranties. If laws applicable to you do not allow the disclaimers or limitations above to the extent written, those provisions shall apply to you only to the extent permitted by such laws. Nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to contravene any mandatory rights you have under law; instead, this section is intended to provide the maximum protection to us (the App developer) allowed by your jurisdiction's laws.
